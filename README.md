Obtain the density distribution of an ultracold quantum gas from a single shot absorption image using a U-net.
Work in progress.

This project adapts the U-net based approach to single shot density reconstruction presented in arXiv:2003.01643 (absdl.github.io). 
It is written for the Lithium experiment in the quantum matter group at the University of Hamburg, but is designed to be flexible with regard to the input data. 
The purpose behind the reimplementation is to allow me to play around with offsets and the network structure a little.
